# Security Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the application.

## Authentication & Authorization

### Firebase Authentication
- Uses Firebase Authentication for user management
- JWT tokens for API access
- Custom claims for role-based access control

### Firestore Security Rules
- User-specific data access control
- App-level access validation
- No public read/write access
- Proper authentication checks

### Storage Security
- Authenticated access only
- No public file access
- Proper file type validation

## Client-Side Security

### Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated
- XSS prevention through sanitization
- Rate limiting on API calls

### Data Sanitization
- HTML entity escaping
- SQL injection prevention
- Cross-site scripting protection

## API Security

### Cloud Functions
- Authentication middleware
- Rate limiting
- Error handling
- CORS configuration

### Request Validation
- Token verification
- Input sanitization
- Audit logging

## Best Practices

### Environment Variables
- Never commit sensitive data
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Separate dev/prod configurations

### Error Handling
- No sensitive data in error messages
- Proper logging without exposing internals
- Graceful degradation

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper session management

## Monitoring & Logging

### Security Events
- Authentication attempts
- Failed access attempts
- Data modification events
- Rate limit violations

### Audit Trail
- User actions logged
- Data access tracked
- Configuration changes recorded

## Incident Response

### Security Breach Protocol
1. Immediate access revocation
2. Data integrity verification
3. User notification
4. Security review and updates
