## 🔧 Hosting Configuration

Your Firebase hosting is configured in `firebase.json`:

```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "build",
    "ignore": [
      "firebase.json",
      "**/.*",
      "**/node_modules/**",
      "functions/**"
    ],
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ],
    "headers": [
      {
        "source": "**/*.@(js|css)",
        "headers": [
          {
            "key": "Cache-Control",
            "value": "max-age=31536000"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "source": "**/*.@(jpg|jpeg|gif|png|svg|webp)",
        "headers": [
          {
            "key": "Cache-Control",
            "value": "max-age=31536000"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## 🌐 Domain Configuration

### Custom Domain Setup

- ✅ Static file caching (1 year for JS/CSS/images)
- ✅ Gzip compression enabled
- ✅ CDN distribution worldwide
- ✅ Automatic minification

### Bundle Size Analysis
Your current bundle size is **581.42 kB** (gzipped). Consider:
- Code splitting for large components
- Lazy loading for routes
- Tree shaking unused dependencies
- Image optimization

## 🔄 Continuous Deployment

### GitHub Actions (Already Configured)
Your project has automatic deployment set up:
- **PR Preview**: Deploys to preview channel on pull requests
- **Merge to Main**: Deploys to live channel on merge

### Manual Deployment Workflow
1. Make code changes
2. Test locally: `npm start`
3. Build: `npm run build`
4. Deploy: `npm run deploy`

## 🛡️ Security Headers

Your hosting includes security headers:
- **Cache-Control**: Optimized caching for static assets
- **Content Security Policy**: Configured for React apps
- **HTTPS**: Enforced for all connections

## 📱 PWA Configuration

Your app is configured as a Progressive Web App:
- **Service Worker**: For offline functionality
- **Manifest**: App metadata and icons
- **Installable**: Users can install on mobile devices

## 🔍 Monitoring & Analytics

### Firebase Analytics
- Automatic page view tracking
- User engagement metrics
- Performance monitoring

### Error Tracking
- JavaScript error reporting
- Performance monitoring
- Real-time alerts

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Failures
```bash
# Clear cache and rebuild
rm -rf build/
npm run build
```

#### Deployment Issues
```bash
# Check Firebase CLI
firebase --version

# Login again if needed
firebase login

# Check project configuration
firebase projects:list
```

#### Performance Issues
```bash

npm run build
# Check the build output for large files
```

### Debug Commands
```bash
# View hosting configuration
firebase hosting:sites:list

# Check deployment status
firebase hosting:channel:list

# View hosting logs
firebase hosting:log
```

## 📈 Scaling Considerations

### Current Limits
- **Bandwidth**: Unlimited
- **Storage**: 10GB included
- **Requests**: 125K/day included

### Upgrade Options
- **Blaze Plan**: Pay-as-you-go for higher limits
- **Custom Domain**: Professional branding
