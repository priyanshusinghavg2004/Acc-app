## 🚨 Security Incident Response

### Immediate Actions (0-1 hour)
1. **Assess the incident**
   - Determine scope and impact
   - Identify affected systems/users
   - Document initial findings

2. **Contain the threat**
   - Revoke compromised credentials
   - Disable affected services if necessary
   - Implement emergency security measures

3. **Notify stakeholders**
   - Alert security team
   - Inform affected users
   - Contact Firebase support if needed

### Short-term Actions (1-24 hours)
1. **Investigate thoroughly**
   - Analyze logs and audit trails
   - Identify root cause
   - Document evidence

2. **Implement fixes**
   - Patch vulnerabilities
   - Update security rules
   - Deploy emergency updates

3. **Communicate updates**
   - Provide status updates
   - Share security recommendations
   - Update incident documentation

### Long-term Actions (1-30 days)
1. **Post-incident review**
   - Conduct lessons learned session
   - Update security procedures
   - Implement preventive measures

2. **Recovery and monitoring**
   - Restore affected services
   - Monitor for recurring issues
   - Implement additional safeguards
