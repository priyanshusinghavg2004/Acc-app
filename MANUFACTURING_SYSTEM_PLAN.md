## TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Database Structure:
```javascript
// Business Configuration
businessType: 'pure-manufacturer' | 'pure-service' | 'service-cum-manufacturer'

// Production Orders
productionOrders: {
  orderNumber: string,
  businessType: string,
  processSteps: [], // For manufacturers
  serviceComponents: [], // For service providers
  materials: [], // BOM
  labor: [], // For service cum manufacturers
  timeline: {},
  status: string
}

// Process Templates
processTemplates: {
  businessType: string,
  steps: [],
  materials: [],
  timeEstimates: {},
  qualityChecks: []
}
```

### UI/UX Strategy:
1. **Adaptive Interface**
   - Show/hide features based on business type
   - Customized dashboards
   - Relevant workflows

2. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Basic features first
   - Advanced features on demand
   - Guided setup process

---

## NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Add Business Type Selection**
   - Setup wizard for new users
   - Configuration panel for existing users

2. **Modify Current Manufacturing Module**
   - Make it adaptable to different types
   - Add process workflow support
   - Implement flexible BOM

3. **Create Type-Specific Templates**
   - Pre-built workflows
   - Standard BOMs
   - Best practices

### Development Priority:
1. **Pure Service** (Simplest to implement)
2. **Service cum Manufacturer** (Medium complexity)
3. **Pure Manufacturer** (Most complex, full features)

This plan ensures the manufacturing system can serve all three business types effectively while maintaining simplicity for basic users and providing advanced features for complex manufacturing operations.
